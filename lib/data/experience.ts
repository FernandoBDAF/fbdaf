      'Everything shifted. After years intentionally coding without AI - afraid dependence would limit my growth - I began exploring tools like Cursor and Claude Code. They didn’t replace understanding; they expanded it. This was the year I started studying LLM foundations, context engineering, and agentic workflows, realizing AI could become a cognitive layer above code.',

    description:
      'This was my first deep immersion into modern engineering. I built with Next.js, React, and Go - delivering features while grounding myself in fundamental concepts.

      'I committed to becoming a software engineer. I studied algorithms and system design through MIT and Stanford courses, while also diving into the Sempre Fichas Management System - the project that had been part of my life for years. What started as exploration became real development work. By the second half of the year, I was working as a full-stack engineer.',

      'I had spent a year living in the United States at this point, stepping away from day-to-day control of my company in Brazil. It was a decisive moment: I shifted into an advisory role and began focusing on the technical side. This was the turning point that opened the path to reinvent myself as an engineer.',
